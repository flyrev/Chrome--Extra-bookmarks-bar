Installing this plugin:
Clone the repo (or download the .zip file, or whatever).
Go to Extensions->Load unpacked extensions and choose the folder.

You'll be all set! Now there will be an extra bookmarks bar.

Please note that this is javascript hackery, and will never be perfect. Google Chrome does not support any way to make it perfect. However, I gladly read suggetions on how to improve it. Send them all to flyrev@gmail.com.

The plugin can be installed directly from the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extra-bookmark-bar/pacejegmplpbkcpaphckhlfaefmmjkpd).
